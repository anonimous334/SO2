== RUNNING ==

In order to run the test suite you can either use the _checker
script or run the run-test executable.

The kernel module must be named ssr.ko and must be in the current folder.

The run-test executable has to be in the current folder. You can create
a link using:

	ln -sf _test/run-test run-test

The _checker script runs all tests and computes assignment grade. You
can use any of the two commands below.

	make test
	./_checker

In order to run a specific test, pass the test number (1 .. 78) to the
run-test executable.

	./run-test 5
